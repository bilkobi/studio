- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to evoke a sense of wisdom and history.
- Background color: Light lavender (#EDE7F6), a very desaturated tint of the primary color.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688), an analogous color providing good contrast for buttons and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Literata', serif font, for a literary, slightly formal feel.
- Simple and clean layout with a focus on readability.
- Use minimalist icons, if any, to represent historical figures or concepts.
- Subtle fade-in animation when a new quote is displayed.
